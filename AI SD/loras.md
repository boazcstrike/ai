This asset is designed to work best with the Pony Diffusion XL model, it will work with other SDXL models but may not look as intended.

CLIP SKIP in ComfyUI

-1 gray picture with noise and spots

-2 picture looks the same as in the preview

If you do not add the CLIP Set Last Layer node, the result will be exactly the same as -2.

(It will not work correctly with other SDXL checkpoints.)

Does not work with any other models!

except Pony Diffusion V6 XL or models with Pony Diffusion V6 XL in the merge!

You can of course use with other models you no one forbids it, but I do not guarantee a good result!

LoRAs without Trigger Words! but there are words used in training! (Some models have Trigger Words)

Bonus Characters
Additionally, this model includes representations of other characters like Vanellope, Shank, Raya, Namaari, Asha, and Rapunzel with short hair. While these extras are included, the quality may vary.

Quick Tips
Direct Name Usage: You can summon any princess by directly invoking their names, such as Anna, Ariel, Aurora, Belle, Cinderella, Elsa, Asha, Jasmine, Merida, Moana, Mulan, Namaari, Pocahontas, Rapunzel, Raya, Shank, Snow White, Tiana, Vanellope.

LoRA Scale: Optimal LoRA scales range between 0.6-0.7 for close-up character generation and 0.3-0.5 for full-body generation. Combining these scales using the ADetailer plugin can yield enhanced results. Ensure an adequate number of sampling steps for better output.

Base Models: Although various base models can function, models with animation styles like DreamShaper, RealCartoon, RevAnime, or AnimeMerge are preferred for optimal performance.
